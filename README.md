## Pitch:

predict how successful a Kickstarter campaign will be based on the monetary
goal, description, campaign length, or categories.

## Your Role

Your primary role is User Interface (UI) Developer:

    •   [ ] You will build a 2 marketing pages for a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by your group and provides the user with details about the product your team has selected to build.

    •	[ ] Your marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths. Please see the "Responsiveness" portion of your rubric for more information on this.

    •	[ ] The call to action on the website should be a login button that links the user over to the React application that your Front End Architect is building.

    •	[ ] Your marketing website must be hosted on a hosting platform like "Netlify" or "Github Pages".

    •	[ ] For this Marketing site's home page you need to have content and copy that relates to the product that your team is working on.

    •	[ ] Descriptions about the product and about the features it provides would be key.

    •	[ ] For a second page, you could do an about us section that includes images of the members of your team, and links to one another's socials/Github.

- A form component allows a `user` to enter the `metrics` of a potential `campaign`. 
(Note: data from the form will be submitted to the DS API.)
- When the form is submitted, the `prediction` (DS API response) is saved to the current `campaign`.
- A `user` can delete `predictions` from their `campaign`.
- A `user` can edit and delete campaigns from their profile.
